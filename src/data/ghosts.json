      "The simplest way to identify a Deogen by its behavior is for players to stand in a room that is comfortably big enough to kite the ghost in, but would be less likely for it to enter by being more distant from the favourite room. Make sure that everyone's electronics are turned off as well to prevent the ghost from being naturally led to the room. If the ghost sounds very fast as it rushes directly to where players are located before slowing down as it gets close, then it is a Deogen.",
      "A more advanced version of this strategy, applicable to larger maps, is to have players hiding across several different locations, each with varying distances to the ghost room. As the Deogen targets whoever is closest to it when it hunts, the player nearest to the ghost will be targeted; this player will also \"manage\" the ghost for the rest of the hunt. Provided players do not accidentally trap themselves in a tight space with no way out, surviving a slowed Deogen is almost trivial as it is virtually impossible for it to catch up to its targets so long as they keep moving."
