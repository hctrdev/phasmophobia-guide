If the ghost sounds very fast as it rushes directly to where players are located before slowing down as it gets close, then it is a Deogen.",
      "A more advanced version of this strategy, applicable to larger maps, is to have players hiding across several different locations, each with varying distances to the ghost room. As the Deogen targets whoever is closest to it when it hunts, the player nearest to the ghost will be targeted; this player will also \"manage\" the ghost for the rest of the hunt. Provided players do not accidentally trap themselves in a tight space with no way out, surviving a slowed Deogen is almost trivial as it is virtually impossible for it to catch up to its targets so long as they keep moving."

As long as the player is within range of the Yurei when it performs its ability, the sanity drain will apply even if there are no doors. Look out for sudden drops in the sanity of individual players, or what may feel like an early hunt; these may be a result of the Yurei using its ability.",

It may still walk around within the room.  If you detect it moving outside of the room before that, it's not a Yurei."
