## How to use

**1.** ‚úÖ Select which evidence you have identified (or excluded)

**2.** üëÄ See which ghosts could match that evidence

The table on the right will automatically update to only show ghosts that match those observations

**3.** üîç Look for the missing evidence

Evidence that can't be found will be greyed out in the left panel

**4.** üìñ Get more information on each ghost

Expand the section for each ghost to see more information

_The "i" icon on the left side will toggle on or off some extra tips to help find ghosts üïµÔ∏è_

## Realtime Sync

If you are playing with friends you can keep your observed evidence in sync with each other!

While connected any change a person makes will be automatically synced to everyone else in the same room, making it easier to work together üôå

_Note that enabling this feature wll use [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as the backend storage and sync server_

## Running Locally

The following commands allow running the project locally.
This assumes you have a working Javascript/ReactJS development environment.

Note that while installation may require an internet connection to download dependencies, the app functional while running offline.
The only exception is the realtime sync feature which, by definition, requires an internet connection.

**1.** `npm install`

This installs all the necessary dependencies.

**2.** `npm start`

This runs the app locally. Once it has started, you can access the app at [http://localhost:3000/phasmophobia-guide](http://localhost:3000/phasmophobia-guide).
